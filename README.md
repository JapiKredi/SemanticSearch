<b>Semantic Search</b>
Search, or the more technical term ‘information retrieval’, is the process of retrieving relevant information from a large collection of data. 
Semantic search can be considered to be a subset of information retrieval that seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the user's intent 
and the contextual meaning of terms by applying the principles of embedding space. 
Semantic search uses vector search and machine learning techniques to return results that aim to match a user’s query even when there are no word matches.

Semantic search focuses on the semantic understanding of the query and the documents by generating and comparing vector embeddings. 
Word Embeddings can be used to capture the semantic meaning of words and measure the similarity between words or documents. 
In semantic search ( sometimes also known as dense retrieval), the objective is to extract the document that matches closely with the user’s query. 
Semantic search systems go beyond simple keyword matching and take into consideration the context, 
semantics and conceptual relationships between words to match a user query with the corresponding content. 
As a result, a semantic search system can understand the intent and meaning behind a user's query and match it with relevant documents even if the query and the documents use different words or phrasing. 
After representing the pieces of text or documents in a high-dimensional space, the vector embeddings of the query and the documents can be compared using a distance metric such as cosine similarity. 
The search problem is now converted to a nearest neighbour method to find the phrase that closely matches with the vector embeddings of the query phrase and vice versa.

<b>Optimal Chunking for LLM Applications</b>

Chunking is crucial for LLM-related apps, breaking down text into smaller segments to enhance content relevance from vector databases. This post explores chunking's impact on efficiency and accuracy in LLM applications, emphasizing the need for semantically relevant embedding with minimal noise.

For Pinecone indexing, chunking ensures embedding aligns with the content's context, crucial for precise search results. Finding the optimal chunk size is vital to maintain accuracy in search outcomes, whether for semantic search or conversational agents.

Embedding short and long content results in different behaviors. Sentence-level embeddings focus on specific meanings, while paragraph or document-level embeddings consider overall context. The length of queries influences embedding preferences, impacting search precision.

Various factors affect chunking strategy, such as content nature, embedding model, and query expectations. Considerations include content type, model performance with specific chunk sizes, and the application's purpose.

Methods for chunking include fixed-size chunking, content-aware chunking (e.g., sentence splitting), recursive chunking, and specialized chunking for structured content like Markdown or LaTeX. Choosing the right method depends on the use case.

Determining the best chunk size involves preprocessing data, selecting a range of chunk sizes based on content and model capabilities, and evaluating performance through queries. There's no one-size-fits-all solution; finding the optimal approach requires iterative testing.

In conclusion, chunking is essential for LLM applications, impacting search accuracy and relevance. While common methods exist, the choice depends on specific use cases, emphasizing the need for iterative testing to determine the best chunking strategy.
