Search, or the more technical term ‘information retrieval’, is the process of retrieving relevant information from a large collection of data. 
Semantic search can be considered to be a subset of information retrieval that seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the user's intent 
and the contextual meaning of terms by applying the principles of embedding space. 
Semantic search uses vector search and machine learning techniques to return results that aim to match a user’s query even when there are no word matches.

Semantic search focuses on the semantic understanding of the query and the documents by generating and comparing vector embeddings. 
Word Embeddings can be used to capture the semantic meaning of words and measure the similarity between words or documents. 
In semantic search ( sometimes also known as dense retrieval), the objective is to extract the document that matches closely with the user’s query. 
Semantic search systems go beyond simple keyword matching and take into consideration the context, 
semantics and conceptual relationships between words to match a user query with the corresponding content. 
As a result, a semantic search system can understand the intent and meaning behind a user's query and match it with relevant documents even if the query and the documents use different words or phrasing. 
After representing the pieces of text or documents in a high-dimensional space, the vector embeddings of the query and the documents can be compared using a distance metric such as cosine similarity. 
The search problem is now converted to a nearest neighbour method to find the phrase that closely matches with the vector embeddings of the query phrase and vice versa.
